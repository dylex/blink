blink(1) daemon for control and system monitoring

blinkd is a daemon for controlling blink(1) which can multiplex different
sources for blink(1) activity (additively).  It includes a control socket with
a command-line interface (blink), a load-average blinker, a maildir monitor,
and other things I've found useful.  It currently has no configuration so
you'll have to edit the code if you want to change or add new features.
